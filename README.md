# OOAD-PROJECT
This was a team project made during our Object Oriented Design and Analysis Course. It is a basic course allotment system through java applet as an interface. The project was made during learning phase of Object Oriented Programming so it is purely based on its concepts. The applet has many bugs and security issues for real world usage. The project is made by taking care of fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming by using appropriate modules, dividing each modules into classes and writing reusable similar functions in a single class. The idea behind the project was to learn programming through objects and classes rather than to develop a usable applet. For this purpose, we have used Java as our platform to work on the project because it is a powerful object oriented language.

##BRIEF WORKING
1. The project is developed on Java as a platform.
2. The applet uses database to store user credentials. For maintaining database mysql has beed used.
3. All the mysql queries are made from Java through JDBC.
4. For user interface Java Applet has been used.
